Lending Club Loan Data Analysis (Deep Learning)
Developed a deep learning model to predict loan defaults using Lending Club data from 2007-2015, aiding in risk management for financial institutions. 
Key steps included data preprocessing, EDA to analyze feature relationships, and feature engineering to reduce dimensionality. 
The model was built and trained using Keras with TensorFlow, focusing on accuracy and handling the dataset's imbalanced nature.
